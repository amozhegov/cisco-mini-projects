To interact with the sensors, press ALT while clicking on each sensor (in the case of the potentiometer and the flexibility sensor, you must press ALT while holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse to interact with these sensors). Observe if the behavior of the actuators corresponds to what was requested in the programming.

This system features 8 LEDs (Components -> Actuators -> LEDs) and a pushbutton (Components -> Sensors -> Toggle Push Button). The LEDs are initially turned off.

When you press the pushbutton, the currently lit LED will turn off, and the next LED in the sequence will light up. Only one LED will be illuminated at a time. The sequence will continue to progress through each LED in order.

Once the 8th LED is illuminated, pressing the button will reset the sequence, turning off all LEDs, and starting the iteration again from the beginning.

This LED Sequence Controller provides an engaging way to observe the progression of LEDs and adds an interactive element with the pushbutton, allowing you to control the sequence with a simple press.

To activate the switch, simply press the ALT key and click on the switch. Once activated, you can sit back and watch the coffee maker turn on, brewing your favorite beverage.

To deactivate the coffee maker, use the convenient ALT + Click combination on the switch. The coffee maker will gracefully turn off, ensuring energy efficiency and safety.

Additionally, you have the option to observe the log of each MCU (Microcontroller Unit), enabling you to track the messages sent and received by the coffee maker during its operation.
